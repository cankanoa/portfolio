# Mapping Urban Spaces for Street Performance

An analysis of optimal urban spaces for street performances based on foot traffic, acoustics, and spatial arrangement.

## Urban Design Considerations

Street performances require specific spatial arrangements. The ideal space has good acoustics, protection from elements, and natural audience gathering areas.

## GIS Analysis

Using Geographic Information Systems, we can map ideal performance locations by analyzing pedestrian traffic patterns, ambient noise levels, and physical features.

## Case Studies

Examples from major cities show how successful street performance spaces often share common geographic and architectural features regardless of cultural context.
